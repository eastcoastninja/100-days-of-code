# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Complete Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Priciples, and CSS Flexbox

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the concept of the css flexbox but after plugging in different properties and seeing how each of them reacted on the console. This made understanding the flow considerably easier.

### Day 1: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Frame of this project 

**Thoughts**: I learned that not having libraries like bootstrap to fall back on slows down the process but this shows where my gaps are. I'm currently stuck on the organizing the structure of my content with flexbox and making my image responsive but I'll get there!

### Day 2: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tribute Page

**Thoughts** The refreshed page looks really good! Definitely need to read more on design patterns and learn to use the flexbox and grid system better. Key take away if you need to build something fast use libraries like bootstrap to build upon.

### Day 4: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Week 1 CS50 Shorts

**Thoughts** Learned how to use and appreciate the power behind debugging.This practice can save hours of time stepping through each line of code and seeing what is happening vs what you want to happen.
