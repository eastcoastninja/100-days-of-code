# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Complete Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Priciples, and CSS Flexbox

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the concept of the css flexbox but after plugging in different properties and seeing how each of them reacted on the console. This made understanding the flow considerably easier.

### Day 1: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed logic to print the correct amount 

**Thoughts**: I learned that it isn't necessary to return a variable within the scope of the main function since the variable is available globally.
