# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
My Goal is to complete as much as the freeCodeCamp curriculum as possible during the challenge.

## Contents

1.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
1.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
1.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
1.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
